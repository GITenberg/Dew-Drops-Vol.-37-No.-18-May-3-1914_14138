    <p>It was a warm May afternoon: all the little flowers were stretching up their heads
    to catch the rain that was falling patter-spatter everywhere. Francis stood by the
    window pouting. He had been playing lovely games outside, and now the rain had
    spoiled his fun.</p>
    <p>Mother was at her sewing machine. She felt sorry for Francis, he was such a little
    boy and he had no playmates, but she was too busy to invent games for him. But he
    began to make up one for himself. He came and stood by the machine and hummed as it
    hummed, louder and louder. Then the humming almost died away, as mother ran the wheel
    slower.</p>

    <br />

    <p>"Oh, dear." Francis said. "I want something to do." Just then he heard a robin
    singing in the rain. He tried to sing with the bird, as he had hummed with the
    machine, and was surprised that he couldn't.</p>
    <p>"Why can't I, mamma?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Because you are Francis, and the robin is robin, I suspect," said mother,
    laughing. "You can do many things that the robin can't, you know."</p>
    <p>Francis threw himself down on the sofa and watched the bird as it swung back and
    forth in the apple tree, and by and by he dropped asleep. When he woke up he ran to
    the window to find the robin.</p>
    <p>"Oh, he's gone," he said, very disappointed. "Did you hear what he told me,
    mamma?"</p>
    <p>Mother shook her head.</p>
    <p>"Why, he said to me that little boys can't sing with their lips as sweetly as
    birds can, but they can sing with their hearts: are you sure you didn't hear him,
    mother?"</p>
    <p>"I'm sure as sure," said mother. "But I know that's what you heard him say in your
    dream for it's true as can be."</p>
    <p>"What did he mean, mother?"</p>
    <p>"He meant that in spite of rain, little boys can be happy, just as the birds are,
    and can carry smiling faces to show they have singing hearts."</p>
    <p>Francis laughed happily. "I'll try to have a singing heart. Oh, the sun's out, and
    I'm going out to find the robin."</p>

    <h3>THREADING NEEDLES.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>Mrs. Sargent's sunny sitting room was a very busy place that Wednesday
    afternoon.</p>
    <p>Four long sticks with their corners fastened together by wooden pegs, and placed
    on the backs of chairs, made a large frame in the center of the apartment. On this
    frame there were basted, first, some strips of pale blue cheesecloth sewed together,
    then cotton wadding was arranged evenly over this, and over all another large square
    of cheesecloth of dainty pink, was placed.</p>
    <p>Now, I dare say that all you little readers know what this meant. It was a
    quilting-frame, of course, and the half-dozen ladies gathered around it were busily
    engaged in tying a comfortable; and, more-over, that same comfortable was to be sent
    to a good missionary out on our Western frontier.</p>
    <p>There was a big box of other things to be sent, too&mdash;but never mind about
    them now; it is the pink and blue comfortable in which we are most interested.</p>
    <p>Little Ruth Sargent was also interested in it. She wished that she were tall
    enough and nimble enough with her fingers to help fasten the pretty little tufts of
    white Saxony yarn that tied the comfortable. The work must be very pleasant to do,
    for the ladies seemed so happy.</p>
    <p>How nice it was to think of making a sensible gift like that, to keep the dear
    missionary lady warm during the long, cold winter nights in far North Dakota!</p>
    <p>Presently, a round, fluffy, white something tumbled off the quilting-frame and
    rolled along on the carpet beneath.</p>
    <p>"Oh, there goes my ball of Saxony!" exclaimed Mrs. Dalton. "I was trying to thread
    my needle&mdash;my eyes aren't as good as they used to be&mdash;and the yarn slipped
    out of my hand."</p>
    <p>Now, Mrs. Sargent didn't have to tell her daughter to pick up the worsted ball,
    for Ruth was a polite little thing, and the ball had hardly ceased rolling, before
    she had scrambled under the quilting-frame and picked it up. Then she thought of
    another polite thing to do.</p>
    <p>"Please let me thread your needle, Mrs. Dalton," she said sweetly.</p>
    <p>"Oh, thank you, deary, that will be such a help!" the lady replied.</p>
    <p>"My! my!" laughed the other ladies. "Now, Mrs. Dalton, you will beat us all in
    tying, for you've got a fine assistant!"</p>
    <p>"Why, I can thread all the needles," Ruth said, her eyes shining. And so she did.
    Needle after needle was threaded with the white yarn, and it really was surprising to
    see how much faster the ladies could work. It wasn't long before all the surface of
    the comfortable was filled with rows of neat, white tufts and was ready to be ripped
    from the frame and have its edges finished with herringbone stitches.</p>
    <p>And Ruth felt very happy, for though she was only seven years old, she had helped
    in the making of the pretty comfortable for the dear missionary lady away out in
    Dakota.</p>

    <br />
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>You hear him softly, softly creep,</span><br />
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>And if you turn around to peep</span><br />

    </center>
    <br />

    <p>For a long time Teddy had wanted a cart, and when his seventh birthday came, there
    by the back door stood the "Eastern Mail" with a birthday letter from grandpa on the
    seat:</p>
    <p>"Dear Teddy," it said, "I know you've wanted a cart for a long time so I hope you
    will like my birthday present. Have a good time with it, and give somebody else a
    good time with it, too."</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Your loving,</span><br />
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Grandpa."</span><br />

    <p>Teddy played nearly all day with his new present, and for a week he cared for very
    little else. One day he raced up the walk, dragging his cart behind him, and dropped
    down on the piazza steps near where mother was sitting.</p>
    <p>"That's a dandy cart, mother," he exclaimed. "Jack Hoyt says it's the best one on
    the street. It's awfully strong, and it can go just as fast as anything. I tell you
    grandpa got a great bargain when he got the Eastern Mail."</p>
    <center>
      <img src='images/illus05.jpg' width='400' height='375'
      alt='Teddy played nearly every day with his cart.' />
    </center>
    <center>
      <b>Teddy played nearly every day with his cart.</b>
    </center>
    <br />

    <p>"Then you're doing just what grandpa wrote you to do with the cart?" mother
    asked.</p>
    <p>"What's that? Have a good time with it?" Teddy answered. "I guess I am. I just
    wish grandpa could see how many miles that cart goes a day."</p>
    <p>"But grandpa wanted you to do something else with it, too," mother added. "Do you
    remember about that?"</p>
    <p>"No, I don't," Teddy replied slowly. Then after a minute's thought he exclaimed,
    "Oh! He said to give somebody else a good time, too, didn't he, mother?"</p>
    <p>Mother nodded.</p>
    <p>"But I don't see how I can give anybody else a good time with it except Mary and
    Ned, for all the boys have either a cart or a bicycle or something, so they don't
    care about playing with mine."</p>
    <p>"Well, dear, keep watch and see what else you can do. There may be some chances to
    make somebody else happy. Will you take this jelly over to old Mrs. Atwood, now?
    She's been sick again."</p>
    <p>Teddy started off with the jelly, and in half an hour he came rushing back with
    his face beaming.</p>
    <p>"Oh, mother," he called. "Mrs. Atwood says that Mrs. Carter will give her a stove
    for her sitting room, but she thinks it's going to cost a lot to get it moved. It's
    only a little one, and do you s'pose I could take it over from Mrs. Carter's in my
    cart?"</p>
    <p>"I'm sure you could, if it's not very big," mother answered heartily. "I guess
    Mrs. Carter's son would lift it in for you, and we could find some man to get it out
    at Mrs. Atwood's."</p>
    <p>Teddy ran to the cellar for the Eastern Mail and in a few minutes it was rattling
    down the street towards Mrs. Carter's.</p>
    <p>"I've come to move that stove over to Mrs. Atwood's," he explained politely, when
    Mrs. Carter opened the door.</p>
    <p>"Do you think it will go in your cart?" the lady asked in surprise. "Wait just a
    minute, and I'll get my son to see if he thinks it can go in that way."</p>
    <p>Rob Carter was as sure as Teddy himself, and in a little while the stove was
    aboard, and Teddy was carefully drawing the Eastern Mail to Mrs. Atwood's, and Rob
    Carter went along to steady the stove and lift it out when they got there.</p>
    <p>"I can't thank you enough," Mrs. Atwood said when the stove was in place. "It's
    helped me a lot to get the stove brought over."</p>
    <p>And as the Eastern Mail turned toward home she slipped a couple of lovely cookies
    into its owner's hand.</p>

    <h3>WHY MINNIE COULD NOT SLEEP.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>She sat up in bed. The curtain was drawn up and she saw the moon, and it looked as
    if it were laughing at her.</p>
    <p>"You need not look at me, moon," she said. "You don't know about it; you can't see
    in the daytime. Besides, I am going to sleep."</p>
    <p>She lay down and tried to go to sleep. Her clock on the mantel went "tick-tock,
    tick-tock." She generally liked to hear it, but to-night it sounded just as if it
    said, "I know, I know, I know."</p>
    <p>"You don't know, either," said Minnie, opening her eyes wide. "You weren't there,
    you old thing! You were upstairs."</p>
    <p>Her loud noise awoke the parrot. He took his head from under his wing and cried
    out, "Polly did!"</p>
    <p>"That's a wicked story, you naughty bird," said Minnie. "You were in grandma's
    room; so now!"</p>
    <p>Then Minnie tried to go to sleep again. She lay down and counted white sheep, just
    as grandma said she did when she couldn't sleep. But there was a big lump in her
    throat. "Oh, I wish I hadn't!"</p>
    <p>Pretty soon there came a very soft patter of four little feet, and her pussy
    jumped upon the bed, kissed Minnie's cheek, and then began to "pur-r-r-r, pur-r-r."
    It was very queer, but that, too, sounded as if pussy said, "I know, I know."</p>
    <p>"Yes, you do know, kitty," said Minnie, and then she threw her arms around kitty's
    neck and cried bitterly. "And&mdash;I guess&mdash;I
    want&mdash;to&mdash;see&mdash;my&mdash;mamma!"</p>
    <p>Mamma opened her eyes when she saw the little weeping girl coming, and then Minnie
    told her the miserable story.</p>
    <p>"I was awfully naughty, mamma, but I did want the custard pie so bad, and so I ate
    it up, 'most a whole pie, and then&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, I don't want to
    tell, but I 'spect I must; I shut kitty in the pantry to make you think she did it.
    But I'm truly sorry, mamma."</p>
    <p>Then mamma told Minnie that she had known all about it. But she had hoped that the
    little daughter would be brave enough to tell her all about it herself.</p>
    <p>"But mamma," she asked, "how did you know it wasn't kitty?"</p>
    <p>"Because kitty would never have left a spoon in the pie," replied mamma,
    smiling.</p>

    <h3>HOW ROBBIE HELPED.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>Little Robbie Denham was a good boy, though very active and full of play.</p>
    <p>Aunt Abbie Peyton had been spending a few days with the Denhams, and one afternoon
    as she sat talking with Robbie, she said:</p>
    <p>"Do you do something to help someone each day, Robbie?"</p>
    <p>Robbie laid Nab, the kitten, down and sat in deep thought for a moment, after
    which he answered:</p>
    <p>"I pick up kindlings for mamma and run errands for her. Is that what you mean,
    Aunt Abbie?"</p>
    <p>"It is a part of what I mean. You should be very kind and helpful to the dear ones
    at home. But I was hoping you could find some way to help someone outside of your own
    home. Of course, you are a little boy, but you can do some small thing for an aged or
    helpless one."</p>
    <p>"I don't know of anything now, auntie; but I'll keep on the watch to see."</p>
    <p>"That is right. We should be on the lookout to see what work there is for as to
    do."</p>
    <p>The next morning as Robbie was having a fine run with his dog Rover, he saw Granny
    Dorn, who was lame, hobbling along to get her cow, which had gone down the lane to
    eat grass.</p>
    <center>

      alt='Robbie was playing with Rover.' />
    </center>
    <center>
      <b>Robbie was playing with Rover.</b>
    </center>
    <br />

    <p>"I could do that kind of work for granny," said Robbie, "but it's such a pretty
    morning, and Rover does play so nice!" Then he walked along slowly for a moment,
    until a bright thought came to him. "Why, I can run with Rover after the cow, and
    come back slower, so as to be rested for another run." Away he went until he overtook
    granny, and said:</p>
    <p>"I'll get your cow every night and morning, if you wish. Just see how fast I can
    go! But I'll be careful and not run the cow, 'cause my papa says they will not give
    so much milk if you do."</p>
    <p>"That is a good boy," said the old woman. "I'm going to bake some seed-cakes,
    to-day, and I'll give you a couple."</p>
    <p>"But I do not ask anything. I just wanted to help you a little. Auntie Peyton told
    me to try to do something to help folks, 'cause that's right."</p>
    <p>When Robbie had driven granny's cow into the yard, he ran home and told Aunt
    Abbie:</p>
    <p>"It's 'most as good as just running with Rover; and getting the cow helps granny,
    you know. Is that the kind of work you wanted me to do?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, dear. I am sure you have made a very good beginning. You can see if there is
    anything else for you to do. If one learns to keep his eyes open, he will have a
    chance to help a good many people."</p>
    <p>"I'm going to keep my eyes open, Aunt Abbie."</p>

    gently. She had tried so many different ways to have Donald learn to remember.</p>
    <p>"Mamma, let's have a forgetter, for Don, or any of us. Just a big
    closet&mdash;that one upstairs with the window will do. Let's put all our forgets in
    there. Anything that's spoiled because we forget it, goes in there, for us to mend or
    to think of some way to make good. If we forget, we have to go there for the very
    next hour&mdash;unless it's schooltime&mdash;no matter how we want to do something
    else."</p>
    <p>"Shall we try that, Donald?" asked mamma. She knew that Uncle Rod was coming
    within that hour to take the children to ride.</p>
    <p>Donald knew it, too, but his voice did not falter, "Yes, mamma, let's begin now. I
    do want to stop forgetting."</p>
    <p>So up to the big closet they went, mamma, and Donald, each carrying some of the
    wilted pansy plants. There was a low stool to sit on, and there Donald spent the next
    hour thinking as he had never thought before. He heard Uncle Rod come and go away
    again.</p>
    <center>
      <img src='images/illus07.jpg' width='250' height='461'
      alt='Donald spent the next hour thinking.' />
    </center>
    <p>It was a long time before Donald forgot again, then for days it seemed as if he
    almost could not remember. Every day for a week, he had to spend an hour in the
    "forgettery." Not one of the other children had had to use it, so it began to be
    called "Donald's forgettery." He had invented a little play with the figures on the
    paper and the boards in the floor, so the time did not seem long at all. He was
    laughing when mamma came to let him out, and she asked what he was doing, and so
    Donald told her of his game.</p>
    <p>Then mamma asked Donald if it was quite right to play, when he was put there to
    think. Of course it wasn't. He had not thought of it that way. He had grown careless,
    because of this game, and to-day Uncle Rod had come again and this time Donald had
    missed going to the city and seeing the new steamer that was to be launched.</p>
    <p>"I want to stay here another hour to-day, mamma, and it'll be the very last time
    I'll have to come. I'm going to think so hard I never can forget." It was the hardest
    thing Donald could remember ever happening, losing this trip with Uncle Rob.</p>
    <p>As he promised mamma, it was the last time he ever forgot anything he ought to
    remember.</p>
    <p>Then the forgettery had a new use. All the children would open the door and put in
    things they wanted to forget. Bessie put in her hurt feelings, when Alice forgot to
    come for her on the way to Mabel's party. Donald put in his anger, when Ben let go of
    the kite string and it sailed away never to come back. Robert put in his
    disappointment when papa wanted him to work in the garden instead of going
    fishing.</p>

    <h3>A SOFT ANSWER.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>"Oh, Emma, where are you going?" asked Kitty, as she ran after her sister.</p>
    <p>"I'm not going to tell you where I'm going; so there!" replied Emma.</p>
    <p>"You're just the hatefulest girl I ever saw," said Kitty, beginning to cry.</p>
    <p>These two little girls did not remember the verse their teacher had given them the
    Sunday before. It was this: "A soft answer turneth away wrath, but grievous words
    stir up anger." Emma's rough answer stirred up an angry feeling in Kitty's heart.
    They were grievous words and brought a reply of the same kind. How much better it is
    to help each other to do right and to be gentle.</p>
    <p>Miss Maggie had heard what the girls said, for she was just coming into the house.
    She had a rose in her hand, and just as Emma ran away, leaving Kitty in tears, she
    held out the rose, saying to Kitty:</p>
    <p>"Smell it, dear; is it not beautiful?"</p>
    <p>The sweet words and the beautiful flower calmed Kitty's angry heart. Miss Maggie
    told her to keep the rose, and when Emma came home, instead of finding a cross little
    sister she found Kitty very happy.</p>
    <p>"Come see my rose," said Kitty. Emma smelled it and said, "Oh! How sweet it is!"
    and they forgot their unkind feelings.</p>
    <p>What power there is in a gentle word. Kind actions, too, are opposed to anger; the
    good will drive out the bad.</p>
    <p>"Do your duty as if you enjoyed it."</p>

    <h3>Strange Little Duckbill.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>If you lived in Australia, you would hear the natives call the little duckbill by
    three different names&mdash;Tambreet, or Tohunbuck, or Mallangong. Are they not
    queer-sounding names?</p>
    <p>But the little duckbill is a queer animal, too. Its mouth looks like a duck's
    bill. Some people name it the Water Mole, because its fur looks like the mole's coat,
    and because it is fond of the water.</p>
    <p>When dogs first see Master Duckbill, they watch him waddle along in his funny,
    awkward way and bark at him, but they will not touch him. When cats first see this
    queer creature, they scamper quickly out of sight.</p>
    <p>Master Duckbill is a skillful burrower and makes long tunnels in the earth with
    his strong claws. His round body is thickly covered, first, with woolly fur and then
    with long hairs. A leathery hanging protects his round eyes from the earth in which
    he burrows.</p>
    <p>Being fond of the water, he always builds near a stream&mdash;usually by some
    quiet pond or the still, wide part of a river. He makes two doorways. One he reaches
    by land; the other, by diving into the water. The land door is always carefully
    hidden under weeds or bending plants, so that no stranger can find it. Yet, often you
    can see the footprints of this little worker in the wet soil.</p>
    <p>To look at Master Duckbill, you would not think he is so active: and he is so
    strong that you could not hold him in your hands. He is a wonderful climber; so that,
    if you had him in your house, you would soon see him running up your bookshelves or
    clambering along some other piece of furniture. He would put his back against the
    wall, his feet against the bookcase, and thus he would travel upward to the top.
    Sometimes boys try to climb up a barn that way.</p>
    <p>When Master Duckbill is swimming, he looks like the bunches of weeds floating in
    the water. But he cannot stay there too long, for he grows very tired trying to
    float. He will leave the water and travel through his curving hallway till he comes
    to the end where his nest is. There, resting on a soft bed of grasses and dry weeds,
    he finds his two baby duckbills. They are only ten inches long, but Master Duckbill
    is proud of them. And well he might be. Do you not think so?</p>

    <center>

    <h3>For Sake of the Younger Ones.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>"Ralph, you went down town without permission after you came home from school
    to-day. Did you forget the rule about that?"</p>
    <p>"I did forget, mamma, but what's the use of the rule, anyhow? I'm a pretty big
    fellow, it seems to me, to have to ask every time I want to go out. And there's a lot
    of rules that I think I might do without that are well enough for Archie and Bess."
    Ralph spoke in a fretful tone, and looked abused. It seemed to him that his mother
    did not realize what a great boy he was, or she would allow more liberty in many
    ways.</p>
    <p>"It is partly for the sake of Archie and Bess that I make the rules for you, and I
    insist upon having them kept," said mamma. "The younger ones cannot understand why
    you should have more privileges in these ways than they have, and if I allowed you to
    do as you please, even if you should generally please to do right, it would make it
    much harder for them to obey rules laid down for them."</p>
    <p>"It isn't very nice for me, though," grumbled Ralph. "I don't see why it should be
    made hard for me just for their sakes."</p>
    <p>"It ought not to be hard, when you think of the reason, my boy. The rules are good
    for you, too, and even if they were needless, you should obey cheerfully for the sake
    of the younger ones. It is only fair, I am sure, that an older brother, who can help
    a great deal with the younger ones if he will, should gladly set them a good example,
    and even deny himself a little for their sakes."</p>

    <h3>Conquering Fear in the Child by Common Sense Methods.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>"It is evident that the first and most important step to be taken in fighting fear
    in the child is the establishment of physical health," is the conclusion of Dr.
    Josiah Morse in <i>The Sunday Magazine</i>.</p>
    <p>"Whenever a parent finds that a child is becoming timorous, she may be sure that
    the child is not enjoying perfect health. A physician should straightway be
    consulted. Fear thrives upon weakness; it also aggravates weakness. Many a child has
    been weakened mentally and physically by fright or a shock, or by witnessing frequent
    expressions of fear in its mother.</p>
    <p>"So we may say that the best way to fight fear is carefully to avoid inducing it
    in children, and to be on the watch, so as to be able to nip in the bud those fears
    which are more or less natural to children, and which appear of their own
    accord."</p>
    <p>Dr. Morse holds that frequent calming and explanative conversations with the
    child, analyzing things that appear to cause it fear, and showing that grounds for
    fear do not exist, suppression of fearsome emotions in the parent, and strict
    cultivation of the child's physical health will take from it those mental torments
    which afflict so many.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
